    Description:        Python script that simulates a deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA).
                        Accpeting input (e.g., aabbaa) and speicific configuration files, the program
                        will compute whether the provided input is Accepted or Rejected.

    Variable Descriptions: (Q, Sigma, Gamma, Delta, S, I, F)
            * Q         Largest state subscript.
            * Sigma     A finite set of input symbols.
            * Gamma     A finite stack alphabet.
            * Delta     Possible transitions. Structure is: (Current State, Char, Stack, Next State, New Stack)
            * S         The start state.
            * I         The initial contents of the stack.
            * F         The final state.
